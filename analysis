Pricing: Walmart’s Great Value Vitamin D Milk is the most affordably priced milk, followed by Kroger’s and Target’s in-house brands respectively.  
Another point to note is the price of Dairypure, a brand by Dean. The price of Dairypure is higher in Walmart compared to its price in Dollargeneral. 
Walmart ensures that its Great Value brand is always priced lower than other brands thus pricing Dairypure higher. One might assume that the difference in price may 
be because of the difference of quality in the Great Value and Dean brand. However, Dean is not only the company behind Dairypure but also supplies milk to the Great Value brand, 
thus juxtaposed between opportunity and threat. 

Rating:  The highest priced Dairypure also has the highest rating of 4.6. A frugal consumer can consider purchasing Great Value which has the second highest rating
and is also priced to be the most affordable. This data is to be taken with a pinch of salt as the set of customers reviewing Target’s milk may be different from those 
reviewing at Walmart.
